# Exploratory Data Analysis on Zomato Dataset
I was always fascinated by the food culture of Bengaluru. Restaurants from all over the world can be found here in Bengaluru. From United States to Japan, Russia to Antarctica, you get all type of cuisines here. Delivery, Dine-out, Pubs, Bars, Drinks,Buffet, Desserts you name it and Bengaluru has it. Bengaluru is best place for foodies. 
The number of restaurant are increasing day by day. Currently which stands at approximately 12,000 restaurants. 

The basic idea is analyzing the Buisness Problem of Zomato to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurant at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant and many more. I have provided the link to download the dataset at the end of this notebook.
